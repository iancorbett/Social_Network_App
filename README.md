# Social_Network_App

Description:



User instructions:

This is not a deployed repo, so anyone looking to use this application will have run it locally in their own code editor, instead of using it in the browser. Firstly, the repo must be cloned and opened in a code editor, such as VSCode which is what I use in the walkthrough. Then the necessary packages must be installed. You will need MongoDB and express for this application to work. You will run the server file in the integrated terminal to start the application. You will then need to open up the insomnia app, as well as the mongoDB compass. However, you will need to build the routes in insomnia. Once the routes are built, you will be able to get, modify, delete and add all of the data that you need to for the application.

For this project, I did not have any starter code or copy any code from other projects or repositories. However, I did receive help from a tutor named Joem. I was having as issue with adding friends to users, as well as issues adding reactions to thoughts. Additionally, when I would attempt to grab this data using insomnia, it would always return an error. Joem helped me to debug this issue, which turned out to be coming from my routes. I needed to add two put routes that were previously forgotten, and this solved the issue. Additionally, I received help writing a few of the routes shown in insomnia in the walkthrough video.
